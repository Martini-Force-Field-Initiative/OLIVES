# Examples

Examples of the test system of Ubiquitin in complex with UBA domain from Cbl-b ubiquitin ligase

Each folder contains a "build.sh" script that will set up the system. Have a look for inspiration.

Folders:

2OOB_quaternary - the complex combined into one topology with a quaternary network, retaining the complex starting structure

2OOB_quaternary - the complex combined into one topology with a quaternary network with quaternary bond energies downscaled by 0.5 

2OOB_no_quaternary - the complex with separate protein topologies and no quaternary network, retaining the complex starting structure 

top - containing standard Martini v3.0.0 parameters
