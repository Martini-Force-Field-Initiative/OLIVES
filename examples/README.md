Examples for the test system if Ubiquitin in complex with UBA domain from Cbl-b ubiquitin ligase

Each folder contains a "build.sh" script that will set up the system. Have a look for inspiration.

Folders:
2OOB_quaternary - the complex combined into one topology with a quaternary network, retaining the complex starting structure
2OOB_no_quaternary - the complex with separate protein topologies and no quaternary network, retaining the complex starting structure 
top - containing standard Martini v3.0.0 parameters
